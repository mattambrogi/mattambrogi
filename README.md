### Hey, I'm Matt

I'm a programmer interested in building useful products. I'm currently doing a batch at [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). Before that, I worked as a product manager on Capital One's machine learning platform. 

For the past few months I've been focused on building web apps and deepening my understanding of computer science. I've mainly been working with Python and Django, but have also spent time learning React, training and deploying machine learning models, and exploring Solidity.

If you'd like to find out more about me, you can visit my [personal website](https://www.mattambrogi.com/). 

If you'd like to take a look at some of my projects, here are a few to start with:

- [Strava Analysis](https://github.com/mattambrogi/strava-analytics-app)
- [DC Crime Dashboard](https://github.com/mattambrogi/dc-crime)
- [Blogging Platform with Django Rest Framework & React](https://github.com/mattambrogi/react-django-blog)
